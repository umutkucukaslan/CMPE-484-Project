You can find the outline on how to use codes in this directory, below.


mergeAudioAndVideo.py
	This python script is to combine sil.avi and sil.wav files into one video file with .MOV extension. We used this script to combine video and audio files that matlab funcitons generate in this folder. This script is called from terminal with command "python mergeAudioAndVideo.py"

preprocessingVideos.m
	is a matlab function that takes a video and an integer(video and m). It outputs one of each m frames, with the same frame rate. We use this function to lower frame rate with integer multiples. It generates two files in the same folder(sil.avi and sil.wav). You can use "mergeAudioAndVideo.py" script to merge them.

linearVideoInterpolator.m
	is a matlab function that takes video and output frame rate. It uses linear interpolation to predict unknown points in time. It saves output in sil.avi and sil.wav. You can use "mergeAudioAndVideo.py" script to combine them.

videoInterpolatorWithDeformation.m
	is a matlab function that takes video and output frame rate. It approximates motion between successive frames using Demons algorithm with built-in matlab function. It uses motion field weighted by distance to previous frame of the current frame, to warp the image in order to find unkown frame. It saves video and audio files in different files named sil.avi and sil.wav. You can use "mergeAudioAndVideo.py" script to combine them.
