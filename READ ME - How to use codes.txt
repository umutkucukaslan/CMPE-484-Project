You can find the outline on how to use codes in this directory, below.


mergeAudioAndVideo.py
	This python script is to combine sil.avi and sil.wav files into one video file with .MOV extension. We used this script to combine video and audio files that matlab funcitons generate in this folder. This script is called from terminal with command "python mergeAudioAndVideo.py"

preprocessingVideos.m
	is a matlab function that takes a video and an integer(video and m). It outputs one of each m frames, with the same frame rate. We use this function to lower frame rate with integer multiples. It generates two files in the same folder(sil.avi and sil.wav). You can use "mergeAudioAndVideo.py" script to merge them.

linearVideoInterpolator.m
	is a matlab function that takes video and output frame rate. It uses linear interpolation to predict unknown points in time. It saves output in sil.avi and sil.wav. You can use "mergeAudioAndVideo.py" script to combine them.

videoInterpolatorWithDeformation.m
	is a matlab function that takes video and output frame rate. It approximates motion between successive frames using Demons algorithm with built-in matlab function. It uses motion field weighted by distance to previous frame of the current frame, to warp the image in order to find unkown frame. It saves video and audio files in different files named sil.avi and sil.wav. You can use "mergeAudioAndVideo.py" script to combine them.



1) There are also some preprocessed results in this folder. You can find low frame rate videos named as MVI_framerate.MOV

2) Processed images have processed prefix in their names.

3) 'linear' in video file names stands for linear interpolation and 'deform' stands for motion estimation approach.

4) Capital M letter in parantheses stands for that median filtering is also applied.

5) The rest in file names like '15to30' stands for that 15fps video is converted to 30fps video.

PS: 2997 fps stands for 29.97fps in some video file names, not for 2997fps!
